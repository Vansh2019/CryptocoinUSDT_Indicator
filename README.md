Crypto Trend Analysis & Signal Engine

This project is a personal crypto market analysis tool developed using Python 3.x and FastAPI.
It fetches live cryptocurrency price data via public REST APIs and applies technical analysis techniques to identify potential market trends.

The software helps traders understand whether a selected cryptocurrency is likely to move up (Bullish), down (Bearish), or remain sideways, while also providing basic risk-management guidance such as leverage, stop-loss, and take-profit levels.
